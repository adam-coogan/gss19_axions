# GRAPPA Student Seminar 2019: axion group

## Topic

The axion is an excellent dark matter candidate with natural motivation from issues with the Standard Model with very low mass. In brief, what problem was the axion proposed to solve? Given that it is so light, why is it cold rather than hot dark matter? Describe what methods exist and have been proposed to constrain axion dark matter using terrestrial and astrophysical observations.
